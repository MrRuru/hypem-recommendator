TO CONSIDER
* When chaining jobs, consider some syncings may be late to the party
* Check the expiration on recommanders and crawlers at the job level, as they may be enqueued as callbacks
long after being finished
* In that case, handle the bootstraping and the updating well and separately. Maybe needing a threshold of up-to-date records
before the job automatically switches in bootstrapong mode and waits for all to be synced
